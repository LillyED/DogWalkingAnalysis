# Dog Walking Analysis
This project analyses the demand for dog-walking services by scraping data from various sources. The goal is to identify areas with high demand and provide actionable insights for business expansion.

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyse the demand for dog-walking services by web scraping data from various sources. The goal is to identify areas with high demand and provide actionable insights for business expansion.

### Steps in the Project
1. Web scraping data on dog-walking services.
2. Cleaning and organising the collected data.
3. Analysing trends in demand and locations.
4. Visualising the results for easy interpretation.

### Tools and Libraries
~ Python: For web scraping, cleaning, and analysis.

~ Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### Data sources 
~ Web scrapping using results from

### Insights
~ Towns with the most services available: Bromley had the most services but relatively fewer dogs available, indicating saturation.

~ Towns with the highest dog numbers: Tunbridge Wells and Dartford have the highest number of dogs, showing high potential demand.

~ Bickley: Excluded from the analysis as an outlier (due to combining Bromley and Bickley postcodes).

~ Expansion recommendations: Focus on areas like Orpington, Chislehurst, Sidcup, and Dartford, where there is high potential for growth in both dogs and service demand.

### Suggestions 
I suggest advertising in towns like Tunbridge Wells, Dartford, and Sidcup, where there is a significant demand for dog walking services but fewer available options. By targeting these areas with untapped growth potential, you can increase visibility and attract more clients. This strategy would allow the business to meet the demand in locations with high dog ownership but low service availability, ultimately expanding the business and increasing revenue.

### Conclusion 
This analysis reveals areas with high demand for dog walking services, such as Beckenham and Bromley, alongside towns with greater dog populations but fewer services available, like Tunbridge Wells and Dartford. By identifying towns with untapped potential, this data helps target areas with the highest demand for expansion, ensuring the business can strategically grow and meet market needs.
