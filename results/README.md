# Dog Walking Analysis
This project looks at dog walking services and dog ownership across various towns. The goal is to help understand where the demand for dog walking services is highest and identify the areas with the most dogs.

## Towns with the Most Services:
- Bromley remains the leader with 112 services, indicating oversaturation.
- Beckenham and Sevenoaks are still significant, with moderate service counts.
- Bickley, with just 5 services, was kept separate for analysis purposes even though its demand overlaps with Bromley. This approach highlights its specific market niche.

## Towns with the Most Dogs:
- Tunbridge Wells, Dartford, and Sevenoaks have strong demand due to high dog counts.
- Bickley is an outlier with no recorded dogs because it shares postcodes with Bromley, already included in dog counts.

## Key Observations:
- Bromley (including Bickley) has high services but low demand, suggesting oversupply.
- Tunbridge Wells is ideal for expansion due to high demand and moderate competition.
- Keeping Bickley distinct for services highlights untapped potential within Bromley.

## Suggestions:
I suggest advertising in towns like Tunbridge Wells, Dartford, and Sidcup, where there is a significant demand for dog walking services but fewer available options. By targeting these areas with untapped growth potential, you can increase visibility and attract more clients. This strategy would allow the business to meet the demand in locations with high dog ownership but low service availability, ultimately expanding the business and increasing revenue.

## Conclusion:
The data shows that areas like Beckenham, Bromley, and Sevenoaks already have many dog walking services, but there are places like Tunbridge Wells and Dartford with a lot of dogs but fewer services. These towns with fewer services represent a great opportunity for expansion. By targeting these areas, the business can fill the gap where demand for dog walking is high but services are lacking, helping to grow the business in a smart and profitable way.
